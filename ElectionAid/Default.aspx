        <h2>Empower Voters With Information</h2>
        <p class="lead">Election Aid is a free new tool designed to assist voters in gaining information about elections.&nbsp; While it&#39;s easy to find information about national level presidential elections, it&#39;s not as easy to find information about smaller, local elections.&nbsp; Even state-level elections can be difficult.&nbsp; That&#39;s where Election Aid comes in.&nbsp; This easy-to-use tool allows you to find and share information about local and state elections and candidates.&nbsp; </p>
